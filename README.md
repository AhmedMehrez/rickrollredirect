# RickRollRedirect
Clone/Fork this repo, go on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), create an
account if you haven't already, click on 'New Project', follow the
steps from 'Import Git Repository', and you've got yourself a rickroll
URL! You can change the domain by going to your project settings then
'Domains' and clicking 'Edit' on the production domain. Good luck
rickrolling!
